\usage{
table_compweight(
  replist,
  dir = NULL,
  caption = paste("Data weightings applied to compositions",
    "according to the `Francis` method. `Obs.` refers to the number of unique",
    "composition vectors included in the likelihood. `N input` and `N adj.`",
    "refer to the sample sizes of those vectors before and after being adjusted",
    "by the the weights."),
  caption_CAAL = "`CAAL` is conditional age-at-length data.",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{dir}{Directory where the .rda files will be written. The default value
is NULL where a table folder will be created where the Report.sso file is
located associated with \code{replist}.}

\item{caption}{A character string for the caption.}

\item{caption_CAAL}{Additional text added to the caption for models with conditional age at length data.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value specifying if output should be printed
to the screen.}
